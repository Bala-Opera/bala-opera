# Bala Opera
Bala Opera is a publication conceived by Cindy Hsu, Jessica Tsai, and Sharon Yu to celebrate the wide array of creative tools through which people express themselves as individuals. We strongly believe that creativity can be born from anything, and we wish to use this platform to highlight people who are actively creating through uncatalogued outputs in varying mediums. 

The word Bala (Bá - Là) is the Taiwanese Hokkien word for guava, a fruit found so abundantly across Taiwan that the word is adopted colloquially as a synonym for trite, unrefined, or mundane. ‘Bala’ aligns with our intention to focus on the conventional, and ‘Opera’ speaks to our format, which derives meaning from the orchestration of a cast of characters.
